The target of this project is the implantation of 32-bit RISC-V microarchitecture processor based on Harvard Architecture. The single-cycle microarchitecture executes an entire instruction in one cycle. However, the cycle time is limited by the slowest instruction.
In this architecture it provides the following set of RISC-V instructions:
•	R-Type: add, sub, and, or
•	S-Type: sw (store)
•	I-Type: addi (add immediate), andi (and immediate), ori (or immediate), lw (load)
•	B-Type: beq (branch if equal), bne (branch if not equal), blt (branch if less than)
•	J-Type: jal (Jump and Link)
